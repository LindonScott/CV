  This method is ugly - essentially using an imbedded table with seven elements
  and another   imbedded table with seven elements within a table.
  (AKA two tables as the two columns of a bigger table.)
  This works but CSS offers more effective table methods that we'll explore later.

There are many attributes that define colors, outlines, etc. for tables. MDN has good resources.
These are "depricated," which means that they are not recommended.
This is because style shouldn't be mostly structured with CSS.
For demo sake, I added some padding.
Additionally, you can move the heads down to the table section, but
table features, such as frozen rows, will not be as easy to create.
